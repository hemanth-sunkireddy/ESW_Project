you can estimate the dissolved oxygen (DO) in water approximately using various formulas that take into account parameters like pH, temperature, pressure, and total dissolved solids (TDS). One commonly used formula for estimating dissolved oxygen is the following:

DO (mg/L) = A * (S / (1 + (B * T))) * (1 + C * P) * (1 - (D * TDS))

Where:

DO is the dissolved oxygen concentration in milligrams per liter (mg/L).
A, B, C, and D are empirical constants that depend on the specific water body and conditions. These constants can vary and may need to be determined through calibration or local data.
S is the solubility of oxygen in water at the given temperature and pressure. The solubility of oxygen decreases as temperature increases and increases as pressure increases.
T is the water temperature in degrees Celsius.
P is the atmospheric pressure in atmospheres (1 atm is approximately 101.3 kPa).
TDS is the total dissolved solids concentration in the water in mg/L.
Please note that this formula provides an approximation and may not be highly accurate in all cases, as it relies on empirical constants that can vary. 
Additionally, other factors such as biological activity and water chemistry can affect dissolved oxygen levels. 
For more accurate measurements, it's recommended to use specialized dissolved oxygen probes or sensors that directly measure DO in the water.

Also, keep in mind that dissolved oxygen levels can be influenced by various factors such as biological activity, water flow, and mixing, so it's important to consider these factors when estimating DO.
