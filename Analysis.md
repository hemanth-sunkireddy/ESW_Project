### Fish Count Effects
- pH is directly propoertional to the Fish count.
  - Suppose fish count is more, it means that fish releases more ammonia in water.
  - thus basicity of the liquid increases veryu slightly.
  - Thus we can measure the pH and send message to the user either to decrease fish count or change water periodically.
- Dissolved oxygen measure decreases in increase of fish count.
  - Suppose we increase fishes. that means they respire more O_2.
  - So we need to increase oxygen supply by turning ON the water fountain
  - else we could send the user an message to decrease the count.
- turbidity value changes when there are more number of fishes.
    - We cannot identify the turbidity accurately when there are more number of fishes.
    - so we need to tell the user to either decrease its count or increase water level



### OUR ELEVATED THOUGHTS :
- We can implement cage on a river to sea area such that river fishes donot flow into the sea water where the pH and Salinity changes.
